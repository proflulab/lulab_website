        "Lu Lab originated from Professor Lu's deep reflection on his two children's education. While teaching mathematical finance at HKUST, he witnessed the rise of the internet wave, foresaw the opportunities brought by technological revolution, and subsequently started entrepreneurship achieving financial freedom.",
        "His Silicon Valley experience revealed that even top university graduates face employment challenges, while those who engaged with computers early and excelled in computer communication were highly sought after. This led him to spend five years researching educational methods, successfully applying them to his own children.",
        "With a heart to give back to Tsinghua University, Professor Lu hopes to help more students overcome basic computer skills and English learning difficulties. He innovatively designed a family-friendly learning model, delivering quality educational content directly to learners through the internet, enabling effective parental participation and companionship.",
        "Drawing from Stanford University's educational philosophy, the lab is committed to popularizing advanced educational methods through online platforms, realizing the vision of making elite education accessible to ordinary families. Facing the mismatch between traditional education and modern society's needs, the lab cultivates future talents adapted to new economic development through innovative educational models."
